## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To follow along with this course, you should have Python 3.x installed on your machine. We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to manage your Python environment and packages.

### Installation

1. On Windows machines, open the Anaconda PowerShell Prompt (as an administrator) and enter the following commands:
   ```bash
   conda create --name cd224-pyenv python=3.10
   conda activate cd224-pyenv
   conda install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas sympy

2. On Unix machines use your preferred package manager to install conda. Make sure to add conda to .zshrc or appropriate shell configuration file.

## Folder Structure

* /assignments/ - Contains homework and assignments for students.
* /solutions/ - Includes solutions to assignments (locked until the due date).
* /data/ - Contains datasets used in examples and assignments.

## Course Materials
You will find lecture notes, code examples, and related materials in the following format:

* __Lecture Notes:__ Jupyter notebooks that provide explanations and code snippets for each topic.

* __Code Examples:__ Python scripts to demonstrate concepts with real-world data.

* __Assignments:__ Problem sets that help reinforce the concepts learned in each module.

## Assignments
Each week includes an assignment to be submitted via Microsoft Teams.
